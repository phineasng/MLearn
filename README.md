# MLearn
## Description
This library is a personal project to refresh and deepen the knowledge of Machine Learning theory and algorithms. 
Due to a recently developed interest in deep learning, the library may reveal a particular focus on topics from this subfield.

## Algorithms implemented
1. Perceptron
2. FeedForward Nets (backprop + L1,L2,Dropout regularizations)
3. RBM: in progress

## Dependencies
* c++11 ( library tested using g++-4.9.2 )
* Eigen >= 3.2.7

### Dependencies for the examples
* openCV

## Contributors
* phineasng
* frenaut
